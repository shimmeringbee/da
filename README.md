## Background

The Device Adapter is a suite of interfaces which define standard behaviour for devices to interact with, including an actual device gateway.

## Install

Add an import and most IDEs will `go get` automatically, if it doesn't `go build` will fetch.

```go
import "github.com/shimmeringbee/da"
```

## Usage

**This libraries API is unstable and should not yet be relied upon.**

This piece of software is not ready for general use.
